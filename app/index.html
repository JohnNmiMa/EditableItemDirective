        <h3> The Jabberwocky - by Lewis Carroll</h3>
        <p> `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

        <p> "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
            The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>

        <p> He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
            Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br>
            So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
            And stood awhile in thought.</p>

        <p> And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
            The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
            Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
            And burbled as it came!</p>

        <p> One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
            The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
            He left it dead, and with its head<br>
            He went galumphing back.</p>

        <p> "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
            Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
            O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br>
            He chortled in his joy.</p>

        <p> `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
